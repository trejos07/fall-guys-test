We're trying to empty this directory in the long run, so don't add things here unless you have a good reason
to not add them to one of the following instead:

Fall Guys Common (if it's game-specific shared data), or:
MPG Utility (if it's game agnostic code or debug/development assets)

Unfortunately Scene files are not currently supported inside a Unity package so they will have to stay here, for now.
